# Interacting_data_Jupyter_Notebook
Notebooks.ai and Jupyter Lab are so simple to interact with our files in our local storage. We will store it securely and access it easily from everywhere.

These examples are taken from the freeCodeCamp Python course, and also they are using an old version of pips, so I solved legend_label and closed problems.
I want to upload these exercises because the help anyone see these problems.
